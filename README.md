This repo has coding sample program for different usecases

In this repository I have perfrmed checkpoiting and dynamic allocation in spark streaming. The main objective of checkpoiting feature is to recover failure messages and can be processed by the spark job. Here we have tested this scenario using the kafka producer. And also I have created test case for that.
